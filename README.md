Predicting Interview Attendance: Using Logistic Regression to Predict the Likelihood that a Candidate Will Show Up for Their Interview

# Abstract
Lack of interview attendance is a growing concern in today’s world. When candidates fail to show up for interviews, it negatively impacts the company by wasting time, resources and effort of the employees. The dataset “The Interview Attendance Problem” offers a variety of factors specific to candidates such as gender, marital status, resident location, interview location, industry, interview type, etc. ​By using a logistic regression model coupled with a best subsets procedure, we highlight which of these factors best predict the likelihood that a candidate will show up for their interview. A comprehensive understanding of these significant predictors can help companies adjust and refine their recruitment process around these identified factors to make it more cost-effective and streamlined.
